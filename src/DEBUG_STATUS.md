# 🐛 Debug Status & Fixes Applied

## What I Just Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Combat Background Image Added
- **File:** `/components/PokemonStyleCombat.tsx`
- **Image:** Dark gothic scene you provided
- **Effect:** Shows behind combat with 30% opacity + gradient overlay

### 2. ✅ Phase 2 Transition Logic Fixed
- **Problem:** Combat waited for 0% HP instead of 50%
- **Fix:** Added check for enemyHealth <= 50% in Phase 1
- **Behavior:** 
  - Phase 1 now ends at 50% HP → triggers mid_battle_vn
  - Phase 2 starts with enemy at 80% HP
  - Phase 2 victory at 0% HP

### 3. ✅ Added Debug Console Logging
- Track enemy HP changes
- See when transitions trigger
- Monitor phase changes
- Identify timing issues

**To see debug logs:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Start combat
3. Watch for messages like:
   - `🎮 Combat Check: { phase2: false, enemyHealth: 70 }`
   - `⚡ TRIGGERING MID-BATTLE TRANSITION!`
   - `🎬 Calling onCombatEnd`

## Current Issues Still Broken:

### 🚨 Audio System NOT WORKING
**Status:** BROKEN  
**Why:** SoundCloud iframe approach is unreliable  
**Files affected:**
- `/components/SoundCloudPlayer.tsx`
- `/components/TutorialEncounter.tsx`

**Recommended fix:** 
- Switch to Howler.js library
- OR use simple HTML5 audio with MP3 files
- See `/AUDIO_DEBUG.md` for full analysis

## Next Steps:

### To Test Phase Transition:
1. Start game
2. Get to combat
3. Use **Probe** action (30 damage)
4. Watch console logs
5. At 50% HP, should trigger mid-battle scene
6. After dialogue choice, Phase 2 starts at 80% HP

### To Fix Audio:
**Option A: Quick Fix (Howler.js)**
```bash
npm install howler
```
Then I'll swap out the audio system.

**Option B: Skip Music**
Just remove audio for now, add later.

**Your call!** Want me to implement Howler.js audio?

## Combat Improvement Ideas (from report):

### Option A: Status Effects
- **Burning** (Flare > 80): Lose clarity each turn
- **Numb** (Flare < 20): Actions less effective
- **Focused** (Clarity > 80): Critical hits more common

### Option B: Item System
- **Herbal Tea:** -15 Flare
- **Journal:** +20 Clarity
- **Heat Pad:** Prevents Burning status

### Option C: Combo System
- **Observe → Probe:** 2x damage, "You understand its weakness!"
- **Soothe → Resist:** No clarity loss
- **Probe → Probe → Probe:** "Overwhelming Questions!" 50 damage

### Option D: More Narrative
- Enemy talks at 75%, 50%, 25% HP
- Different endings based on actions used
- "Violent" path (Resist spam) vs "Understanding" path (Observe spam)

**Which sounds most fun to you?**

## Console Commands for Testing:

Open console and try:
```javascript
// Check current game state
console.log('Current Phase:', state.phase);
console.log('Enemy Health:', state.enemyHealth);

// Force phase change (in TutorialEncounter component)
advancePhase('mid_battle_vn');
```
