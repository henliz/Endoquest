EndoQuest AI System - Setup Checklist
======================================

✅ All code is written and ready
✅ TutorialEncounter.tsx updated with AI components
✅ Backend routes configured
✅ Scene structures defined

NOW YOU JUST NEED TO:

□ Step 1: cd server && npm install
□ Step 2: Create /server/.env with your OpenAI API key
□ Step 3: cd server && npm run dev
□ Step 4: Test at http://localhost:3001/health

THAT'S IT!

Your .env file should look like:
---------------------------------
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_KEY_HERE
PORT=3001
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

Get API key at: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

Once backend is running, just start your game normally:
npm run dev

The tutorial will automatically use AI text input!

Cost: ~$0.01 per playthrough (using gpt-4o-mini)

Troubleshooting:
- Backend won't start? Check you ran npm install in /server
- Invalid API key? Check .env file exists and key is correct
- Can't connect? Visit http://localhost:3001/health to verify backend
