## ✨ Major New Features

### 1. Enemy Attack Patterns
- **Phantom Throb** - Standard damage (+15 Flare)
- **Gaslighting Whisper** - Clarity attack (+10 Flare, -20 Clarity)
- **Flare Spike** - Burst damage when player Clarity high (+30 Flare)
- **Numbing Fog** - Locks Observe next turn (+5 Flare)
- **Shared Suffering** - Phase 2: Damage you deal hurts YOU too

### 2. Telegraph System
Enemy shows warning 1 turn before attacking:
- "Whispers echo..." → Gaslighting Whisper next
- "Form flickers RED!" → Flare Spike next
- "Fog thickens..." → Numbing Fog next

### 3. Action Strengths/Weaknesses
**Observe:**
- STRONG vs Gaslighting (+30 Clarity instead of +20)
- WEAK when Numbed (locked out)

**Soothe:**
- STRONG before Flare Spike (halves damage)
- WEAK after recent use (cooldown: -15% → -20% → -25%)

**Probe:**
- STRONG at High Clarity >70% (45 damage "Deep Probe")
- WEAK at Low Clarity <30% (15 damage)

**Resist:**
- STRONG vs Phantom Throb (better effects)
- WEAK vs Gaslighting (doubles Clarity loss)

### 4. Interactive Tutorial (ONCE ONLY!)
**4 Beautiful Steps:**
1. Welcome to Combat (explains turns)
2. Your Actions (shows what each does)
3. Enemy Telegraphs (explains warnings)
4. Stat Management (Flare/Clarity importance)

**Only shows in Phase 1, NEVER in Phase 2!**

### 5. Mini-Decisions During Enemy Turn
After every enemy attack:
> "The pain radiates... Where do you feel it most?"

- 🦴 **Joints** → +5 Flare, +10 Clarity
- 🔥 **Deep** → +10 Flare, no change
- 🧠 **Everywhere** → +15 Flare, -5 Clarity

**Purpose:** 
- Keeps you engaged
- Collects diagnostic data
- Strategic trade-offs

### 6. Environmental Effects (Every 3 Turns)
- 🌫️ **Fog Thickens** - Clarity gains -5%
- 👻 **Echoes** - Next attack hits twice
- ✨ **Calm** - Soothe fully powered

### 7. Clarity as Resource
- **>70%:** Probe becomes Deep Probe (45 damage!)
- **<30%:** All actions weakened, Probe only 15 damage
- **<20%:** Telegraphs become cryptic (Phase 2)
- **<10%:** Random actions (panic state)

### 8. Phase 2 Mechanics
- **Shared Suffering:** Your damage = +50% to YOUR Flare
- **Clarity Requirement:** Can't win unless Clarity > 60%
- **Cryptic Telegraphs:** If Clarity low, can't read enemy
- **New Move:** Shared Suffering attack available

## 🎮 How to Play (Quick Guide)

### Turn Flow:
1. **Read telegraph** from last turn
2. **Choose counter action**
3. **Watch your action's effect**
4. **Enemy telegraphs next move**
5. **Enemy attacks**
6. **Answer mini-decision**
7. **Repeat**

### Basic Strategy:
- **Early:** Build Clarity with Observe
- **Mid:** Use Deep Probe (Clarity >70%)
- **Late:** Balance damage + Clarity management
- **Phase 2:** Conservative, watch Shared Suffering

### Counter-Play:
- Gaslighting Whisper → **Observe**
- Flare Spike → **Soothe** (beforehand)
- Phantom Throb → **Resist**
- Numbing Fog → Avoid Observe next turn

## 💡 Design Wins

### What This Achieves:

1. **No More Spam** - Can't just Probe repeatedly
2. **Pattern Recognition** - Like Pokémon/Undertale bosses
3. **Resource Management** - Soothe cooldown, Clarity resource
4. **Engagement** - Mini-decisions keep you active
5. **Thematic Depth** - Understanding > brute force
6. **Diagnostic Data** - Pain locations collected naturally
7. **Replayability** - Optimize strategy, different builds
8. **Accessibility** - No twitch skill, turn-based thinking

### Why It Feels Better:

- **Before:** Monotonous damage race
- **After:** Dynamic puzzle with solutions

### Narrative Integration:

- **Probe** = Asking hard questions (hurts but reveals truth)
- **Observe** = Mindfulness (understanding patterns)
- **Soothe** = Self-care (can't do constantly)
- **Resist** = Pushing through (effective but costs insight)
- **Telegraphs** = Learning to recognize triggers
- **Clarity** = Understanding your condition
- **Phase 2 requirement** = Can't overcome pain without understanding it

## 🎯 Player Feedback Expected

### Positive:
- "Oh! The enemy tells me what's coming!"
- "I need to actually think about what action to use"
- "Deep Probe at high Clarity feels amazing"
- "The tutorial is way better than before"
- "Mini-decisions keep me engaged"

### Negative (Expected):
- "Phase 2 is hard because of Shared Suffering" ← INTENDED
- "I can't win with low Clarity" ← INTENDED (teaches theme)
- "Soothe cooldown is annoying" ← INTENDED (prevents spam)

### Questions to Watch For:
- "What's the best strategy?" → There isn't one (context-dependent)
- "Why can't I win?" → Check Clarity in Phase 2
- "What do telegraphs mean?" → Tutorial explains this

---

## 🔮 Future Expansion Ideas

### Easy Additions:
- More enemy moves (6-8 total)
- More environmental effects
- Item system (Herbal Tea, Journal, etc.)
- Combo chains (Observe → Probe = Critical)

### Medium Additions:
- Status effects (Burning, Focused, Numb)
- Special moves unlocked by Clarity thresholds
- Different endings based on playstyle
- Enemy "phases" with different movesets

### Advanced:
- Multiple enemy types with unique patterns
- Player "builds" (aggressive, defensive, analytical)
- Risk/reward "Desperation" moves
- Difficulty modes (enemy smarter/harder)

---

## 📊 Diagnostic Data Enhanced

### Old System Tracked:
- Action choices (observe, probe, etc.)
- Final Flare/Clarity

### New System Tracks:
- Action choices (same)
- Final Flare/Clarity (same)
- **Pain location preferences** (joints, deep, everywhere)
- **Counter-play usage** (did they read telegraphs?)
- **Clarity management** (stayed high or tanked?)
- **Playstyle** (aggressive Probe spam vs defensive Soothe)
- **Phase 2 approach** (conservative or risky)
- **Victory stats** (turns taken, final Clarity %)

**More diagnostic insights with same narrative wrapper!**

---

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### No Breaking Changes:
- Old saves won't break (action format is backward-compatible)
- TutorialEncounter handles both formats
- EnhancedCombat is drop-in replacement

### Performance:
- Same render cycles as before
- No new heavy computations
- Tutorial adds one modal (only shows once)

### Accessibility:
- Still turn-based (no time pressure)
- Clear visual indicators
- Text-based (screen reader friendly)
- Color-coded but not color-dependent

## 🎉 You Did It!

The combat is now a **proper puzzle boss fight** instead of a damage sponge. Players will need to:

- Learn patterns
- Counter attacks
- Manage resources
- Adapt to changes
- Understand to overcome

**Exactly like Pokémon/Undertale, but therapy-themed.** 🧠✨
