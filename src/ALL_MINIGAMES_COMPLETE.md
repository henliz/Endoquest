## 🔥 Flare Crisis Minigames

### When Flare ≥ 100%:
Game randomly selects ONE of three minigames:
- Phase 1: 50% Breathing, 50% Pain Mapping
- Phase 2: 50% Flare Storm, 50% other two

### 1. Breathing Exercise (Improved)

**Trigger:** Flare ≥ 100%

**Screen:**
- Dark background with blur
- Text: *"The pain is overwhelming. You need to breathe."*
- **Pulsing circle** with ripple effects

**Mechanic:**
- Circle animates through breathing cycle:
  - **Inhale (3s):** Grows from 50% to 100% scale
  - **Hold (1s):** Stays at 100%
  - **Exhale (3s):** Shrinks to 50% scale
  - **Rest (1s):** Stays at 50%
- Text changes: "Breathe in..." → "Hold..." → "Breathe out..." → "Rest..."
- Click when circle "feels right" (timing window is forgiving)
- 3 good clicks = Success
- 3 bad clicks = Failure

**Success:**
- Flare drops to 70% (-30)
- Message: *"You've steadied yourself. The pain is still there, but manageable."*

**Failure:**
- Flare drops to 85% (-15)
- Message: *"Your breathing is ragged, but you're still standing."*

**Why It's Better:**
- 4-phase breathing (box breathing)
- Visual ripple effect
- Forgiving timing
- Feels meditative

---

### 2. Pain Mapping

**Trigger:** Flare ≥ 100%

**Screen:**
- Text: *"Where does it hurt most? Point to the pain."*
- Grid of 6 body regions

**Regions:**
- 🔴 Lower Abdomen
- 🟠 Lower Back
- 🟡 Legs
- 🟢 Bowels/Bladder
- 🔵 Chest
- 🧠 Everywhere

**Mechanic:**
- Click 3 regions that hurt
- Each click: Region highlights purple
- After 3 selections: Auto-completes

**Result:**
- Flare drops to 75% (-25)
- Message: *"Naming the pain makes it smaller. Not gone, but knowable."*
- **Diagnostic data:** Tracks which regions clicked

**Why This Works:**
- Empowering (you name the pain)
- Diagnostic gold
- Thematic (understanding = relief)

---

### 3. Flare Storm (Boss Mechanic - Phase 2)

**Trigger:** Flare ≥ 100% in Phase 2

**Screen:**
- Text: *"Brace yourself! The Ache unleashes a FLARE STORM!"*
- 15 fireballs rain down from top
- Each fireball has unique X position and speed

**Mechanic:**
- Click fireballs before they hit bottom (y > 110%)
- Fireballs that reach bottom = missed
- Lasts until all 15 are clicked or missed
- Score tracker shows: Clicked / Missed

**Success** (≥9 clicked, 60%+ success rate):
- Flare drops to 60% (-40)
- Message: *"You weathered the storm! Resilient buff gained."*
- Gain "Resilient" buff (not yet implemented, but mentioned)

**Failure** (<9 clicked):
- Flare drops to 80% (-20)
- Message: *"The flames overwhelmed you..."*

**Why This Works:**
- Kinetic/active
- FEELS like a boss mechanic
- High intensity
- Satisfying clicks

---

## 🧠 Clarity Crisis Minigames

### When Clarity ≤ 0%:
Game randomly selects ONE of three minigames (33% each)

### 1. Memory Fragment Puzzle

**Trigger:** Clarity ≤ 0%

**Screen:**
- Gray foggy background
- Text: *"You're losing yourself in the fog... what was real?"*
- 4 memory statements

**Statements (example):**
- ✅ "The doctor said it was just stress" (TRUE - happened)
- ❌ "You're making this up for attention" (FALSE - gaslighting)
- ✅ "The pain started when you were 15" (TRUE - history)
- ❌ "Everyone has pain like this" (FALSE - normalization)

**Mechanic:**
- Click statements you believe are TRUE
- Selected = highlighted blue
- Click "Remember" button to submit
- Success if ≥50% correct

**Success:**
- Clarity rises to 30% (+30)
- Message: *"The fog clears. You remember who you are."*

**Failure:**
- Clarity rises to 15% (+15)
- Message: *"The confusion lingers, but you're still here."*

**Why This Works:**
- Teaches recognizing gaslighting
- Embodies dissociation
- High narrative impact

---

### 2. Reassembly Puzzle

**Trigger:** Clarity ≤ 0%

**Screen:**
- Text: *"Pull yourself together. Literally."*
- 4 numbered puzzle pieces

**Mechanic:**
- Click pieces in order (1, 2, 3, 4)
- Each click: Piece turns green
- Must click in sequence

**Success:**
- Clarity rises to 35% (+35)
- Message: *"You are whole. You are real."*

**Failure:**
- Not possible (always succeeds if you click all 4)

**Why This Works:**
- Visual/visceral
- Simple but satisfying
- Feels like overcoming dissociation

---

### 3. Affirmation Sequence

**Trigger:** Clarity ≤ 0%

**Screen:**
- Text: *"You're losing sight of yourself. What do you know to be true?"*
- One statement at a time
- TRUE / FALSE buttons

**Statements:**
- "My pain is real" (TRUE)
- "I deserve care" (TRUE)
- "You're imagining this" (FALSE)
- "I know my body" (TRUE)
- "Everyone feels this way" (FALSE)
- "I can trust myself" (TRUE)
- "It's all in your head" (FALSE)
- "I am worthy of help" (TRUE)

**Mechanic:**
- 8 statements, rapid fire
- Click TRUE or FALSE for each
- Tracks correct answers
- Success if ≥60% correct (5+/8)

**Success:**
- Clarity rises to 40% (+40)
- Message: *"You know who you are. The fog can't take that."*

**Failure:**
- Clarity rises to 25% (+25)
- Message: *"The doubts linger, but so do you."*

**Why This Works:**
- Affirms player
- Fast-paced
- Teaches self-advocacy language

## 💬 Dialogue System Deep Dive

### Two Types of Dialogue:

#### 1. Probe-Initiated (Player Choice)

**Trigger:** Player clicks Probe button

**Screen:**
```
You want to ask a hard question...

What will you ask The Ache?

[💭 "Why do you hurt me?"]       → PROBE
[🌊 "Can we coexist?"]           → SOOTHE
[👁️ "What are you trying to tell me?"] → OBSERVE
[💪 "I don't have time for this."]      → RESIST
```

**Why This Works:**
- Probe = gateway to all actions
- Reframes each action as a question
- Player chooses emotional stance
- Same mechanics, deeper narrative

---

#### 2. Enemy-Initiated (After Specific Attacks)

**Trigger:** After Gaslighting Whisper or Flare Spike (70% chance)

**After Gaslighting Whisper:**
```
The Ache stares at you, waiting...

How do you respond?

[😤 "No. I KNOW this is real."]          → PROBE (confronts)
[😔 "Maybe you're right... maybe I imagined it."] → OBSERVE (internalizes)
[🌊 "I don't need to prove anything to you."]     → SOOTHE (boundary)
[💪 "Whatever. Moving on."]              → RESIST (avoids)
```

**After Flare Spike:**
```
The Ache stares at you, waiting...

How do you respond?

[😤 "Why are you doing this to me?!"]   → PROBE (demands answers)
[🌊 "I need to breathe through this pain."] → SOOTHE (self-care)
[👁️ "Let me watch how this affects me."] → OBSERVE (analyzes)
[💪 "I can take it. I'm stronger."]     → RESIST (endures)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Forces emotional response to trauma
- Teaches coping strategies
- Diagnostic gold (tracks responses)
- Every turn = therapy session
