# 🎮 EndoQuest Tutorial: "The Ache Beneath" - Player Guide

## What is this encounter?

"The Ache Beneath" is the first tutorial encounter in EndoQuest, teaching you how to navigate the Fog and face your Ache-Echoes. It combines visual novel storytelling with turn-based combat, using dialogue choices to collect diagnostic information while wrapping it in a magical-realism narrative.

---

## 📖 Story Overview

You wake in a mysterious gothic basin filled with fog. A robed figure called **The Archivist** appears and explains that you've entered the Fog—a liminal space where pain takes physical form. Your first challenge is to confront **The Ache Beneath**, a shadowy manifestation of chronic pain that has been following you.

Through dialogue and combat, you'll learn to **name your pain**, understand its patterns, and integrate it rather than just fighting it. The encounter explores themes of medical gaslighting, chronic suffering, and the power of self-knowledge.

## 🎭 Visual Novel Phases

### Act 1: Awakening
**What happens:** You regain consciousness in a strange place. Gothic architecture, dripping water, purple fog.

**Interaction:** Click/tap to advance the narration.

**Tone:** Disorienting, dreamlike, slightly unsettling.

---

### Act 2: The Archivist
**What happens:** A mysterious guide appears and asks about your past.

**Visual:** Full-screen character portrait of a hooded figure.

**First Question:** *"Do you remember what brought you to the Fog?"*

**Your Choices:**
1. 🔥 **"I remember doctors who didn't listen."** (Frustration)
2. 💙 **"I remember trying to explain pain no one believed."** (Resignation)
3. 🌙 **"I remember thinking... maybe it's all in my head?"** (Self-doubt)

**What this does:** 
- Tracks your emotional response to medical trauma
- No "wrong" answer—each choice is valid
- Shapes how The Archivist responds to you

---

### Act 3: Entering Combat

## ⚔️ Combat System

### Turn-Based Battle Mechanics

EndoQuest uses a **Pokemon/Undertale-style turn system**:

1. **Your Turn:** Choose one of 4 actions
2. **Battle Text:** Message describes what happened
3. **Enemy Turn:** The Ache attacks back (adds Flare damage)
4. **Repeat** until victory condition

---

### The 4 Actions

#### 🔍 **Observe**
*"You watch the pattern carefully. Clarity rises!"*

**Effect:**
- **+20% Clarity** (understanding/insight)
- No damage dealt
- No Flare change

**When to use:** 
- When your Clarity is low
- When you want to study the enemy
- Defensive/analytical playstyle

**Narrative meaning:** Paying attention to your pain, observing its patterns.

---

#### 🌊 **Soothe**
*"You breathe deeply. The pain softens..."*

**Effect:**
- **-25% Flare** (pain/distress)
- **+5% Clarity**
- No damage dealt

**When to use:**
- When your Flare is dangerously high (>80%)
- When you need to calm down
- Self-care playstyle

**Narrative meaning:** Taking a moment to care for yourself, breathe, rest.

---

#### 💬 **Probe**
*"You ask: Where do you live in me? It's super effective!"*

**Effect:**
- **30 damage** to enemy HP
- **+15% Clarity**
- **+5% Flare**

**When to use:**
- Main damage dealer
- When you want to progress combat quickly
- Aggressive/investigative playstyle

**Narrative meaning:** Asking hard questions about your pain, digging deeper even though it hurts.

---

#### 💪 **Resist**
*"You push through the pain. But at what cost?"*

**Effect:**
- **10 damage** to enemy HP
- **-15% Flare**
- **-10% Clarity**

**When to use:**
- When you want to push through
- Balanced damage + Flare reduction
- "Grit your teeth" playstyle

**Narrative meaning:** Ignoring pain to keep functioning—effective but costs you understanding.

---

### Stats Explained

#### ❤️ **Flare** (Pain/Distress Level)
- **Starts at:** 70%
- **Range:** 0-100%
- **What it means:** How much pain/stress you're experiencing
- **High Flare (>80%):** You're overwhelmed, struggling
- **Low Flare (<30%):** You're calm, managing well
- **Enemy attacks increase this** (adds 10-25 each turn)

#### 💙 **Clarity** (Understanding/Insight)
- **Starts at:** 50%
- **Range:** 0-100%
- **What it means:** How well you understand your condition
- **High Clarity (>80%):** You see patterns, recognize triggers
- **Low Clarity (<30%):** You're confused, in the dark
- **Most actions increase this**

#### 🎯 **Enemy HP** (The Ache's Health)
- **Phase 1:** 100% → Defeat at **50%**
- **Phase 2:** 80% → Defeat at **0%**
- **What it means:** How much the Ache resists understanding

---

### Combat Strategy Tips

**Aggressive Strategy** (Speedrun):
- Spam **Probe** repeatedly
- Wins fast but builds Flare
- Enemy attacks will hurt more

**Defensive Strategy** (Safe):
- Alternate **Observe** and **Soothe**
- Takes longer but keeps you stable
- Less risky, more controlled

**Balanced Strategy** (Recommended):
- Mix of **Probe** (damage) and **Soothe** (recovery)
- Use **Observe** when Clarity is low
- Adapts to situation

**Chaos Strategy** (Experimental):
- Use **Resist** heavily
- High damage, low Clarity
- Risky—you might "win" without understanding

---

## 🌙 Phase 1 vs Phase 2

### Phase 1: First Contact
**Goal:** Reduce enemy HP to **50%**

**What happens:**
- Learn the combat system
- Tutorial overlay explains mechanics
- Enemy attacks each turn

**Victory Condition:** 
- When enemy reaches 50% HP, **combat pauses**
- You don't actually "defeat" the Ache yet

**Transition:**
- *"The Ache flickers... something is changing..."*
- Screen transitions to mid-battle dialogue

---

### Mid-Battle Dialogue
**What happens:** The Ache speaks for the first time, revealing it's not just an enemy—it's part of you.

**Visual:** The shadowy enemy's portrait, speaking directly to you.

**Second Question:** *"When the healers failed you, what did that cost?"*

**Your Choices:**
1. 😔 **"It made me doubt everything I felt."** (Self-doubt)
2. 😠 **"It made me furious. I knew I was right."** (Anger)
3. 🌀 **"I stopped trusting anyone. Including myself."** (Detachment)

**What this does:**
- Tracks your response to medical gaslighting
- Adds emotional depth to the combat
- Makes you empathize with the "enemy"

---

### Phase 2: Awakened State
**Goal:** Reduce enemy HP to **0%**

**Visual Change:**
- Red warning overlay: **"⚠️ Awakened State ⚠️"**
- Enemy is "wounded but dangerous"

**Starting HP:** Enemy at 80% (carries over partial damage)

**Difficulty:** 
- Same actions available
- Enemy may hit harder (TBD)
- You keep your Flare/Clarity from Phase 1

**Victory Condition:** 
- Enemy HP reaches 0%
- Combat ends, victory scene plays

---

## 🏆 Victory & Resolution

### What happens when you win:

**Victory Scene:**
- *"The basin calms. The shadow kneels before you..."*
- The Ache doesn't die—it **merges with you**
- "The pain does not vanish; it becomes something you can see, something you can name."

**Power Unlock:**
- You gain **Empathic Resonance**
- New ability: Sense disturbances in the Fog
- First step toward mastery

**The Archivist's Final Words:**
- Explains this was only the first Ache
- Teases future encounters (vines, floods, nerves)
- Reinforces: *"You have a name for your pain, and that is power."*

## 💡 Design Philosophy

### Why therapy RPG?

Traditional diagnostic questionnaires are clinical and alienating:
- "On a scale of 1-10, rate your pain."
- "How many days per month do you experience symptoms?"

**EndoQuest reframes this:**
- Pain becomes a character you can talk to
- Symptoms are puzzles to solve
- Medical history is narrative backstory
- Coping strategies are gameplay actions

### Why turn-based combat?

1. **Pacing:** Forces reflection between actions
2. **Strategy:** Makes players think about their choices
3. **Metaphor:** Living with chronic pain IS a battle
4. **Accessibility:** No twitch reflexes required

### Why visual novel format?

1. **Emotional depth:** Story creates empathy
2. **Context:** Embeds clinical questions naturally
3. **Agency:** Player choices feel meaningful
4. **Immersion:** More engaging than forms

## 🎓 For Designers/Developers

### Key Files:
- **`/components/TutorialEncounter.tsx`** - Main encounter logic
- **`/components/VNScene.tsx`** - Visual novel dialogue
- **`/components/VNChoiceScene.tsx`** - Branching choices
- **`/components/PokemonStyleCombat.tsx`** - Turn-based battle

### State Management:
```typescript
interface TutorialState {
  phase: Phase; // Which scene is active
  flare: number; // Pain level (0-100)
  clarity: number; // Understanding (0-100)
  enemyHealth: number; // Enemy HP (0-100)
  combatTurns: number; // Turn counter
  playerChoices: string[]; // Diagnostic data
}
```

### Phase Flow:
1. `awakening` → Narration
2. `archivist_intro` → Character intro
3. `first_question` → Choice (medical trauma)
4. `basin_response` → Archivist response
5. `transition_to_combat` → Warning
6. `combat_phase_1` → Battle (100% → 50%)
7. `mid_battle_vn` → Dialogue interrupt
8. `healers_question` → Choice (gaslighting)
9. `combat_phase_2` → Battle (80% → 0%)
10. `victory_vn` → Integration scene
11. `power_reveal` → Ability unlock
12. `archivist_final` → Tutorial end

## 📝 Player Feedback to Watch For

### Confusion Points:
- "Why did combat end at 50%?" (Need clearer UI feedback)
- "What's the difference between Probe and Resist?" (Tooltips?)
- "My Flare is at 95%, am I losing?" (No failure state currently)

### Engagement Hooks:
- Character portraits (visual appeal)
- Battle messages (personality, humor)
- Thematic depth (pain as power)
- Accessibility (no fail states, no timer)

### Potential Improvements:
- Add tooltips to action buttons
- Show "Phase 1 Complete" message
- Add fail state? (Flare reaches 100%)
- More enemy dialogue during combat
