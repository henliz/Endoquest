## üéÆ Combat System Analysis

### Current Issues:
1. **Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2 transition broken**
   - Currently triggers at 0% HP (victory)
   - SHOULD trigger at 50% HP (mid-battle)
   - Player gets confused because there's only one combat phase

2. **Enemy Turn Execution**
   - Sometimes doesn't execute?
   - Timing might be off

3. **Tutorial Display**
   - Shows on first combat entry
   - Explains turn-based mechanics
   - Auto-hides after 6s or first action

### Suggested Combat Improvements:

#### Option A: Keep Two-Phase Combat
- **Phase 1 Goal:** Understand the enemy (reach 50% HP)
- **Mid-Battle:** Dialogue reveals enemy's nature
- **Phase 2 Goal:** Integrate the pain (defeat enemy)
- **Benefit:** Narrative arc, builds tension

#### Option B: Single Combat with Milestones
- **One continuous battle** to 0% HP
- **At 75% HP:** Enemy speaks (brief dialogue overlay)
- **At 50% HP:** Enemy transforms (visual change)
- **At 25% HP:** Final words
- **Benefit:** No jarring transitions, maintains flow

#### Option C: "Understanding" System
- **Reduce HP through Probe actions** (damage)
- **Build "Understanding" meter** through Observe
- **Victory requires BOTH:**
  - Enemy HP to 0%
  - Understanding to 100%
- **Benefit:** Thematic depth, strategic choices matter
