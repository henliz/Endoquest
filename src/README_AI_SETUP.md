# 🎮 EndoQuest AI Setup - Final Answer

## ✅ What's Already Done

**All code is written and integrated.** I just modified your `TutorialEncounter.tsx` to use the AI system.

---

## 🚀 What You Need To Do (3 Commands)

### Terminal 1: Install & Start Backend

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (one-time)
cd server
npm install

# 2. Create .env file with your API key (one-time)
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_KEY_HERE
PORT=3001
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173' > .env

# Replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your actual key from:
# https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

# 3. Start backend (every time you develop)
npm run dev
```

Expected output:
```
[server] 🚀 EndoQuest backend running on http://localhost:3001
```

### Terminal 2: Start Frontend

```bash
# In root directory
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 That's It!

The game now has AI text input at 2 points:
1. **Tutorial intro:** "When did your pain begin?" → Type freely
2. **Mid-battle:** "What did the healers say?" → Type freely

Players can now share their story in their own words, and the AI will generate personalized responses while keeping the plot on track.

## 🧪 Quick Test

1. Start game
2. Meet the Archivist
3. **Type:** "My pain started at 15"
4. Click Send
5. **AI responds:** "Fifteen — so young to carry such weight. The basin ripples..."
6. Click Continue → Combat begins!

---

## 📂 Files Modified

I changed **1 file**:
- `/components/TutorialEncounter.tsx` (added AI integration)

Everything else was already created in previous work.

## 💰 Cost

- **~$0.01 per playthrough**
- Uses `gpt-4o-mini` (cheapest GPT-4 model)
- 1000 playthroughs = ~$10

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Backend won't start | Run `npm install` in `/server` directory |
| "Invalid API key" | Check `/server/.env` exists with correct key |
| Frontend can't connect | Visit http://localhost:3001/health to verify backend |
| AI response is weird | Normal during testing - adjust prompts in `/server/prompts/scene-structures.js` |

## 🔄 Want Original Click-Based Version?

The AI system is **additive** - you can switch back by:
1. Reverting `TutorialEncounter.tsx` changes
2. Using `VNChoiceScene` instead of `AITextInputScene`

Or keep both and add a settings toggle!

## ✨ What Players Experience

### Before (Click-based):
```
Archivist: "When did it begin?"

[Click] When I first bled
[Click] It crept in later
[Click] During my cycle
[Click] It's constant
```

### After (AI-powered):
```
Archivist: "When did it begin?"

[Type] My pain started when I was 15, during my first
period. It was so severe I couldn't go to school for 
three days. Everyone told me it was normal, but this
didn't feel normal.

[Send]

AI: "Fifteen — so young to carry such weight. The basin
ripples beneath you, reflecting your words back in waves
of deep violet. You spoke of pain so severe you had to
hide from the world, while others dismissed it as normal.
That isolation has its own ache, doesn't it? The world is
listening now."

[Continue] → Combat
```

**More personal. More diagnostic data. Same plot flow.**

## 🎉 Summary

**YES - Just plug in the API key (after running npm install).**

That's all you need to do. The integration is complete! 🚀
