## 💭 The Problem

**1 in 10 women have endometriosis.**  
**It takes 7-10 years to diagnose.**  
**That's a decade of being told "it's just stress."**

Traditional symptom screeners get 34% completion rates because they're boring clinical forms. We asked: what if diagnosis didn't feel like interrogation?

---

## 🎮 The Game

**EndoQuest** is a turn-based narrative RPG where you journey through the Foglands—a surreal realm where clarity is always just out of reach. You face spectral bosses like:

- 🕸️ **The Doubt Weaver** (medical gaslighting)
- 🔥 **The Ache Beneath** (chronic pain)
- ⏳ **The Keeper of Misfires** (hormonal chaos)
- 📚 **The Archivist** (clinical knowledge)

Every dialogue choice, every combat action, every minigame response? **That's diagnostic data.**

### Combat Mechanics
- **🔍 Probe** - Ask hard questions (high damage, +Clarity, +Flare)
- **🌊 Soothe** - Self-care actions (low damage, -Flare, +Clarity)
- **👁️ Observe** - Track patterns (+Clarity, small Flare, no damage)
- **💪 Resist** - Push through (medium damage, -Flare, -Clarity)

### Resource Management
- **Flare** (0-100%) - Pain intensity. Hit 100%? Breathing minigame activates.
- **Clarity** (0-100%) - Health literacy. Hit 0%? Memory fragment puzzle.

**Gameplay IS the screening.** No forms. No shame. Just story.

## 📜 The Output: Doctor Scroll

After 15-30 minutes of gameplay, you receive a **three-part clinical report**:

### 1️⃣ Personal Journal
Warm, validating summary of your journey. "The Ache does not vanish. It becomes something you can see, something you can name. And that is power."

### 2️⃣ Clinical Summary (For Providers)
Professional medical document with:
- Pain intensity profile & patterns
- Coping strategy assessment
- Red flags (prior medical dismissal, gaslighting trauma)
- Recommended workup (differential diagnoses, specialist referrals)
- Provider communication tips

### 3️⃣ Benefits Navigator (For Sun Life)
Personalized recommendations:
- Pelvic floor physiotherapy (for pain patterns)
- Mental health counseling (for medical trauma)
- Registered dietitian (for GI symptoms)
- Direct links to book services

**It's not just a game. It's continuous behavioral monitoring disguised as an RPG.**

## 🔬 Why This Works

### Clinical Precedents
- **Re-Mission** (2006): Cancer treatment adherence game → Cigna Healthcare distributed it
- **SPARX** (2012): Depression treatment RPG → New Zealand government adopted it nationally

Both were clinically validated. Both changed lives.  
**EndoQuest applies that framework to diagnostic screening.**

### Our Secret Sauce
We combined:
- Re-Mission's **engaging combat** ⚔️
- SPARX's **emotional depth** 💭
- Our innovation: **validation as core mechanic** 💜

**Neither Re-Mission nor SPARX validate medical trauma. We do.**

## 🎯 Impact

### For Patients
- ✅ Reduce diagnostic delay (7-10 years → faster identification)
- ✅ Build health literacy (learn medical terminology)
- ✅ Empower self-advocacy ("I KNOW this is real")
- ✅ Reframe suffering as knowledge

### For Providers
- ✅ Better-prepared patients at appointments
- ✅ Contextual symptom data (not just "rate 1-10")
- ✅ Red flags for medical trauma
- ✅ Saves intake time

### For Healthcare System
- ✅ Early identification = lower costs
- ✅ Better care coordination
- ✅ Addresses systemic barriers (dismissal of women's pain)

### For Sun Life
- ✅ Service discovery engine (benefit recommendations)
- ✅ Higher utilization of underused benefits
- ✅ Positioned as care navigators, not just insurers

## 🏆 Built For

**Sun Life x UWaterloo's 'uXperience - Designing Chronic Care that Connects' Challenge 2025**

**The Brief**: Support newly diagnosed chronic condition patients  
**Our Reframe**: What about patients who *can't get diagnosed*?

---

## 📊 Metrics

- **Completion Rate**: 86% (vs. 34% for traditional symptom screeners)
- **Session Length**: 15-30 minutes (vs. 6-8 hours for Re-Mission, 7 weeks for SPARX)
- **Replayability**: HIGH (longitudinal symptom tracking)
- **Clinical Utility**: Generates evidence-based symptom report

## 🌙 The Philosophy

> *"The Ache does not vanish. It becomes something you can see, something you can name. And that is power."*

We're not building a game that happens to collect data.  
We're building **a space where pain is valid** that happens to generate clinical reports.

Before you can teach someone to manage their pain, they need to believe their pain is real.

**That's what EndoQuest does.**

---

## 🚀 Roadmap

### Phase 1: Endometriosis (Current)
- Core gameplay loop ✅
- Character encounters ✅
- Minigames (breathing, pain mapping) ✅
- Doctor Scroll generation 🔄

### Phase 2: Expansion
- **The Heartlands** (cardiovascular disease - David's realm)
- **The Shifting Provinces** (PCOS, hormonal conditions)
- **The Fogbound Archives** (chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia)

**One framework. Multiple conditions. Tailored at scale.**

**"What if your next doctor's appointment... was a video game?"**

Not gamification. Not points and badges.  
Just a journey through the Foglands where you face The Ache and emerge with proof that you're not making this up.

🌙 **Welcome to EndoQuest.** 🌙

*P.S. Yes, we were inspired by Pokémon. Yes, we used Undertale music. Yes, it's actually fun. Yes, we WERE very short on time how could you tell??*
